## Introduction

Welcome to Swift JSON Schema! Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated. By contributing, you are helping to make this project better for everyone.

## Style Guidelines

- Follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).
- Write clear and concise comments where necessary.
- Ensure your code is well-documented and includes meaningful test cases.

## Code Formatting

All code must be formatted using Swift format to ensure consistency across the codebase. The CI pipeline will check for formatting issues automatically. You can add the `auto-format` label to your pull requests to enable automatic Swift formatting before merging.

### How to Use

1. Create a pull request as usual.
2. Add the `auto-format` label to your pull request.

When the label is added, the CI pipeline will automatically format the code and commit the changes to your pull request.
